# Hi, I'm Nguyen Duy Minh! 👋

**AI Engineer & Data Science Graduate** based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
I specialize in building intelligent agents, scalable data infrastructure, and orchestrating complex AI workflows.

### 🚀 About Me

I bridge the gap between raw data and actionable AI insights. My expertise lies in the full project lifecycle—from designing **ETL/ELT pipelines** to deploying **LLM-powered agents** and **RAG systems**. Currently, I am driving innovation at **FPT Software** on internal AI initiatives.

```python
class AIEngineer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Nguyen Duy Minh"
        self.role = "AI Engineer"
        self.current_focus = "Internal AI Projects at FPT Software"
        self.location = "Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"

    def get_stack(self):
        return {
            "Core": ["Python", "SQL", "PySpark"],
            "AI & LLM": ["LangChain", "RAG", "Gemini", "OpenAI", "HuggingFace"],
            "Data Ops": ["Apache Airflow", "Airbyte", "Docker", "Git"],
            "Databases": ["Weaviate (Vector)", "Neo4j (Graph)", "PostgreSQL", "BigQuery"]
        }
